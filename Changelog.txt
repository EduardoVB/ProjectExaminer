      The Copy to Clipboard feature now adds tab characters instead of spaces to facilitate pasting to Excel.
      Some forms can be flagged unsaved (or changed) just opening them (without making any changes to them). It can be due to an UserControl or third party control. The Add-in opens all the forms, and in the previous version these forms were flagged as unsaved. Now that is fixed in this version, all forms remain in their original "saved/unsaved" state.
      Designer windows remain in their original state (not closed if they were already open).

      The compare criteria in the Find tab now ignored the "&" symbol (that can be common on Captions to set the accelerator key)
      FontName properties not added to the String list anymore.
      Out of memory bug fixed. The designer windows were opened -but not set visible- in the scan and not closed after that, causing an out of memory error on very large projects.
